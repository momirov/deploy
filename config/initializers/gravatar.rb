# You can set the default cache for Gravatar to use:
# Gravatar.cache = ActiveSupport::Cache::FileStore.new

# You can also set the length of time an item in the Gravatar cache is valid. Default is 24.hours
# Gravatar.duration = 20.minutes

# You can also change the logger used by default. It's worth mentioning that, once again, Gravatar will use
# the Rails logger if it's available. Otherwise, the default is $stdout.
# grav_log = ""
# Gravatar.logger = StringIO.new(grav_log) # logs Gravatar output to a String
